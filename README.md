bubble1_size: changing the number follow up with "radius" could change the size of the bubble.
bubble2_motion:changing the number after row 27 and 28 which follow up with "ellipse" on the row 26, changes the range of how the bubble moves around.
bubble3_color: changing the number for the first "fill" on row 20 could change the original color of the bubble; after the "else", changing the number for the "fill" on row 23 could change the color of the bubble when the cursor moves onto it.
bubble4_mouse: since this is my first time touching coding, it took me a little bit of time trying to figure out how to achieve the command for the bubble to move to the place were the cursor is when clicking on the canvas. Finally I deleted the "random" on the row 17 and 18 and solved it. Also, I changed the color of the canvas.
